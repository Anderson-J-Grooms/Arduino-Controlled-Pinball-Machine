# Arduino-Controlled-Pinball-Machine
This is the repository for my Arduino controlled pinball machine. It uses standard electro-magnetic pinball parts for all mechanical systems and utilizes an Arduino for control. All schematics and code (pinballControl.ino) are included. A video demo of the application can be found at this link:
